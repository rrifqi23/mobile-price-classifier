## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their features. We use three different machine learning models to achieve this: Logistic Regression, SVC, and Neural Networks.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobile-price-classification.git
cd mobile-price-classification
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mobile-price-classification
```

## Usage
Run the following command to train and evaluate the models:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Models
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective linear model for binary classification.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A powerful classifier that works well with high-dimensional data.
- **Neural Networks (NN)**: A deep learning model that can capture complex patterns in the data.
